# Movie Revenue Analysis

This project analyzes movie revenue data to identify trends and patterns. It uses a dataset of movie production budgets and revenues to perform various analyses and visualizations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movierevenueanalysis.git
    cd movierevenueanalysis
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure the dataset `cost_revenue_dirty.csv` is in the [data](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) directory.

2. Run the main script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Analysis

The script performs the following analyses:

1. Cleans the dataset by removing unwanted characters and converting columns to numeric types.
2. Identifies movies that were not released as of May 1st, 2018, and drops them from the dataset.
3. Calculates the percentage of movies that lost money.
4. Creates a scatter plot of movie production budgets and worldwide gross revenues, with the release date as a third dimension.
5. Fits a linear regression model to predict movie revenues based on production budgets.

## Results

- The scatter plot is saved as [scatter_plot.png](http://_vscodecontentref_/1).
- The linear regression model's coefficients and R-squared value are printed to the console.
- An estimated revenue for a movie with a $350 million budget is calculated and printed.
